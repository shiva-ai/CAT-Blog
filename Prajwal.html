                        <h5> q) What was your score in 10th , 12th and graduation ? </h5>
<p>a) In 10th i secured 96%, in 12th i got 89.4. I did my B.Tech from VNIT, Nagpur in  Mechanical Engineering branch. My CGPA was 8.38 . Many of the IIMs did not consider the graduation CGPA this year except IIM Lucknow. Even though i am not completely aware about this, i read somewhere that one of the parameters for considering Graduation marks was that you need to be in the Top 20%ile of the candidates. 
</p>
<h5>q) How did you balance the rigourous course-work of mechanical engineering and your CAT preparation ?</h5>
<p>a) i took easy courses during my 7th semester which helped. But i was also appearing for my college placements, which were taking away some time. But once i got placed in the month of July i could pick up my CAT  preparation again. I already had a little bit of foundation as i was preparing since January. But during that period it was not that focused. From July onwards i started giving 1-2 mocks every week. My major source of preparation were these sectional mocks, where i could find different types of questions. When i received my admit card and found out that i was alloted a morning slot, i started giving mocks at that time and analyzed them in the afternoon. This helped me acclamatize with the time slot.
</p>
<h5>q) How did you prepare for VARC ?</h5>
<p>a) I had a habit of reading articles , newspapers etc. so i didn't really do any separate preparation. Also i used to read Aeon essays and referred to some coaching material. Apart from this i used to give a lot of sectional tests. My advice for people who don't have a habit of reading would be to start reading articles in your areas of interest and keep that consistency by venturing into other areas eventually. 
</p>
<h5>q) How did you prepare for DILR ?</h5>
<p>a) Practice is the key. Try to expose yourself to as many different types of questions as possible from as many topics as possible. Again taking sectional tests and various mocks helped me. I used to revisit the questions after a week and try to solve them completely. Another important aspect of DILR section is picking the easy sets. So i used to start by scanning all the sets for first 4-5 mins and then eventually used to make a priority order. Also i tried to read some material online which was available about DILR, regarding my weak topics. 
</p>
<h5>q)How did you prepare for quants ?</h5>
<p>a) Since i came from an engineering background, i didn't feel uncomfortable in quants. But the key here was imporve the speed. i brushed up on all the formulae and tried to improve my speed. Again key here is to pick the easy questions. First i used to glance through all the questions and after that i had a good enough idea, on which to attempt first.
</p>
<h5>q) How was actual CAT exam ?</h5>
<p>a) In VARC i tried to give 30 mins to reading comprehension and the rest of the time for verbal ability. I used to try and attempt all questions, even though my accuracy was low but it made up for the number of questions attempted. I tried to first attempt RCs which had a familiar topics. During the exam i felt my VARC and DILR section didn't go that well. So i panicked a little bit, because of which my quants section went a little bad. I ended up scoring 99.8%ile in VARC and 99.6%ile overall. 
</p>
<h5>q) How did you prepare for the interview ?</h5>
<p>a) I just read current affairs from various news articles. Prepared myself for expected questions like why MBA , etc. Since i was from mechanical background, i just briefly reviwed some important topics from my course-work. Also i researched about the colleges that i was giving interview for. Having a strong personal story which connects and reflects your interests really helps. 
</p>
<h5>q) What were the calls you received ?</h5>
<p>a) IIM A,B,C,L,I,K. XLRI J. My advice to the students would be to consistent in their preparation, because once there is a time gap it becomes hard to retain that flow and give lots of mocks.
